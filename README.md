# Data Science Project: TheMiners
The aim of this project is to analyse skin lesions images and use a clissifer for the detection of differnet skin cancers.

# Data sets
1. The Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000 data set [1],[2] <br>
The first data set was downloaded with the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnistham10000?select=HAM10000_images_part_2

2. The MED-NODE data set [3] <br>
The second data set was downloaded with the following link: http://www.cs.rug.nl/~imaging/databases/melanoma_naevi/

# Code
The Code is aviable via Jupyter Nodebooks: <br>
1. Merging data sets: DataScienceProjektMergingData.ipynb
2. Containing meta data:
3. Training and evalutation of the classifier:
